# 0x02. Session Authentication

## Description
In this project, you will implement a Session Authentication system without using external modules. The goal is to understand how session authentication works by building each component manually. While it's recommended in the industry to use frameworks like Flask-HTTPAuth for this purpose, this project is designed to reinforce the underlying concepts by building them from scratch.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly:
- What authentication means
- What session authentication means
- What cookies are and how they work
- How to send and parse cookies in an HTTP context

## Resources
- REST API Authentication Mechanisms (session auth part)
- HTTP Cookies
- Flask
- Flask Cookies

## Requirements
- **Python Version**: Python 3.7
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Style Guidelines**: PEP 8 (pycodestyle 2.5)

### General Rules:
- All Python scripts will be interpreted using `python3`.
- Your files should end with a new line.
- Your scripts should start with the line `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Code must follow the pycodestyle style.
- Each module, class, and function must have clear documentation.
- All files must be executable.

## Files
- `app.py`: The main application file implementing session authentication.
- `session.py`: Module handling session creation, management, and destruction.
- `auth.py`: Contains authentication methods and cookie handling.
- `README.md`: You're currently reading this file.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chipatenii/0x02-Session_authentication.git
