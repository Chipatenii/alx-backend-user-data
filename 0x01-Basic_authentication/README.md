# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## Description
In this project, you will learn about the authentication process and implement Basic Authentication for a simple API. Though in real-world applications, Basic Authentication should be handled by established modules or frameworks (like Flask-HTTPAuth), this project is designed to teach you the mechanism by building it from scratch.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What authentication means
- What Base64 is and how to encode strings in Base64
- What Basic Authentication is and how it works
- How to send the Authorization header in HTTP requests
